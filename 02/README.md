an [es2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) [d3v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) iteration on the block [Force layout graph with colour-coded node neighbours](http://bl.ocks.org/samuelleach/5497403) from [@samuelleach](https://twitter.com/samuelleach)

---

First attempt at making a colour-coded graph, with code snippets inspired from the D3 community.

Green => Friend and follower.

Red => Follower

Blue => Friend.

Improvements needed:

1) Smooth transition on the arrow head.

2) Better positioning of the arrow heads.
